# Warehouse_Budget_Dashboard

# 📦 Warehouse Budget Dashboard

An interactive Jupyter Notebook that simulates and analyzes a warehouse’s monthly budget using Python. This project blends supply chain strategy with data science — helping operations leaders visualize cost drivers, run scenario simulations, and make smarter decisions.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This dashboard provides a clean, executive-style interface to explore warehouse costs across five categories:

- Labor
- Rent
- Utilities
- Maintenance
- Equipment Lease

It includes interactive widgets to simulate labor cost increases and visualize monthly trends, breakdowns, and heatmaps.

## 📊 Features

- **Interactive Cost Viewer** — Select any cost category to view monthly trends  
- **Monthly Breakdown** — Pie chart of cost distribution by month  
- **Scenario Simulator** — Adjust labor cost percentage and see total impact  
- **Heatmap Overview** — Visualize cost intensity across months and categories  
- **Built with**: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `ipywidgets`
